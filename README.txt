This was for an ai hackathon at the University of Toronto called 'Orbis Challenge'

The idea being this is a framework which uses priority based mission delegation to help connect the low level movement of individual units in a swarm and high level goal setting.

Original text from the hackathon:

Hi, there!

Thanks for participating in this year's Orbis Challenge!

The Orbis Challenge was created in 2010 to inspire
and encourage young people to explore their programming talents,
creative thinking and problem solving abilities.

Your challenge is to build an AI to play a video game in 24 hours.
This year's video game is Luminis, a territory expansion strategy game.

We suggest that, before doing anything else, you read the manual first.
You can read the manual by double-clicking on Manual/index.html in the LUMINIS folder.

Thanks for reading me, and good luck!
